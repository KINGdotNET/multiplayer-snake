To start and play the game, you need to run both the server and the client. Here are the steps:

Step 1: Run the Server

Open a terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the game.py file.
Type python game.py and press Enter to run the server.
Step 2: Run the Client

Open another terminal or command prompt.
Navigate to the directory where you saved the client.py file.
Type python client.py and press Enter to run the client.
Step 3: Play the Game

The client window should appear with a snake and a food pellet.
Use the arrow keys to move the snake around the screen.
Eat the food pellets to grow the snake.
Avoid hitting the edges of the screen or the snake's own body.
The server will keep track of the game state and update the client window accordingly.
Note: Make sure you have Python and Pygame installed on your system to run the game. If you don't have Pygame, you can install it using pip: pip install pygame

Troubleshooting:

If you encounter any errors, check the terminal output for error messages.
Make sure you are running the server and client in the correct directories.
If you are still having trouble, try restarting the server and client.
I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any further questions.
